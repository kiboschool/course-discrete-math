# Proofs

This week, we'll cover the four main proof types: inductive, direct, contrapositive, and contradiction. We'll also discuss how to get started proving a statement, and common pitfalls in proofs.

By the end of the week, you should be able to:

- Write inductive, direct, contradiction, and contrapositive proofs.
- Analyze a problem and decide which proof technique is the best fit.
- Evaluate simple faulty proofs and identify the mistakes.
- Combine proof techniques with casework when necessary.
