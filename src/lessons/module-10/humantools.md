# Human Tools

While the computer runs the code for you, as a developer, you still need some skills to write the code.

## Logic

The basic logic from week 1 relates to how computers operate. Computers cannot interpret instructions that are not clear and precise. Or rather, they could, but might not give the result you desire.

To create code, and in particular, to create efficient code, you should consider the basis of logic, as computers can interpret mathematically logical statements (when written in the form of code).

## Parity

Parity, while not outright discussed, is an important concept related to discrete math. Parity refers to being a part of two groups, usually even/odd. Watch the following video to understand how this is related to a scratched DVD.

## Problem-Solving Strategies

We work out at the gym or at home to gain muscle and keep our bodies healthy. If we want to make our brains strong and healthy, the key is mathematics.

By participating in this course, you are working out your brain, and in particular, your problem solving skills. Not only can you now solve mathematical problems, you should be able to adapt these skills to solve other problems. Many large companies ask riddles or puzzles in their interviews. After taking this course, my hope is that you might be able to solve one after some thinking!

Try solving the riddles below:
