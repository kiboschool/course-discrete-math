# Midterm Exam

We will be conducting the exam using onlineexammaker.

A link to the exam will appear below on 1/30/2024. You must complete the exam by 2/3/2024 11:59PM GMT. No late submissions will be allowed.

You have 45 minutes to take this exam, and it has 21 questions, some being True/False, some multiple choice, some multi-select, and some short answer.

In the exam, you may see the following notation. This is what it means:

R -> R -- $\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$.

1/2 -- The fraction one half.

x^2 -- x raised to the second power.

a_n -- a subscript n.

You may use any of this shorthand in your own answers.

Feel free to do questions in any order.

<!-- [Here is a link to the exam.](https://t.onlineexammaker.com/doexam/QDEepb6bOnq.html) -->

You are allowed to re-take this exam before 2/24/2024. There will only be one retake, and the highest grade will be kept. I **highly recommend** you complete HW 1-3, review the 4th lecture for common mistakes, and do some practice problems before re-taking the exam.

Do not take this exam multiple times without permission.

## Resources ##

This is an open note, open book exam, but it is not open internet.

The following resources are allowed:
- Readings on Anchor.
- Textbooks linked on Anchor.
- Your own notes on material.
- Class recordings (though these will be too time consuming for an exam).

The following resources are **not** allowed:
- MathStackExchange, Khan Academy, or any other online math resource not listed above.
- ChatGPT, Bard, or any other AI service.
- Any other person than yourself (no peers, family members, or otherwise can help you on your exam).
- Any other resources not explicitly listed in the "allowed" list.

Using any unapproved resources during an exam counts as academic dishonesty, and may result in a zero on the exam.
