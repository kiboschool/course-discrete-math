## Bayes Theorem
[Chapter 4](https://math.dartmouth.edu/~prob/prob/prob.pdf#page=144)


These two videos are some of the best videos from 3Blue1Brown in terms of explaining a mathematical concept that is relevant to many areas of real-life situations. Please watch them to understand Bayes Theorem on an intuitive level. Note that these videos are a required portion of your readings for this week.

Feel free to pause, rewind, and think about the ideas brought up in these videos.
