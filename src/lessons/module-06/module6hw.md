# Homework Set 6

## Submitting Your Work

Your work must be submitted to Anchor for degree credit and to Gradescope for grading.

**For any work completed outside of GitHub or Gradescope:**

1. **Typeset your work in LaTeX**.
 - You should use \\begin\{enumerate\} to create a numbered list, and your solutions to each problem should match with the corresponding number on the assignment.
 - For example, if an assignment has 10 numbered problems, your enumerate should have 10 \\item commands, with your solution(s) to problem 1 under the first \\item, problem 2 under the second and so on.
 - If you skip a problem, just leave the \\item blank, otherwise the numbers of your solutions will not match the assignment document.
[Here is an example Overleaf document showcasing this format.](https://www.overleaf.com/read/zqjgpnxycycd#e88392)
2. Compile into a PDF. This can be done easily through an Overleaf account, otherwise you will need to install LaTeX.
3. Submit the pdf to [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com) via the appropriate submission link for the course.
4. Upload the pdf to Anchor using the form below.

> **Note:** Anchor submissions can occur at any time during the term, but it is **critical** that you upload all of your work to
> Anchor before the last day of the term.  Gradescope submissions must be submitted before the deadline (or the late deadline, if applicable).

## ChatGPT/AI

Use of ChatGPT/AI is forbidden for all assignments in this course.

### It is required that all assignments are submitted as a PDF generated from a LaTeX document.

### Assignments submitted in any other form will earn zero credit.

1. Using a combinatorial proof, show that the sum of the $n$th row in Pascal's triangle is $2^n$

2. Using a combinatorial proof, show that ${4n \choose 2} = 4 \cdot {n \choose 2} + 6n^2$

_Hint:_ $6 = {4 \choose 2}$ _and_ $n$ _can also be written as_ ${n \choose 1}$

3. Find the probabilities of the following events:

a. A randomly chosen integer number between 1 and 100 contains a 2.

b. Rolling a sum of 3 on two standard, fair, 6-sided die.

c. Rolling a sum of 3 on three standard, fair 6-sided die.

d. Drawing all 4 letters from our Kibo deck in a hand of 5 cards.

e. A randomly chosen real number chosen between 1 and 10 falls in the range from 2 to 4.

f. A point randomly selected in a square of side length 1 also appears in a circle centered on the square with radius $\frac{1}{2}$.

4. Imagine there's a test for a disease that only 0.5% of people have. The test has a 99.9% sensitivity rate, and a 99% specificity rate.

a. If a person has a positive result, what is the probability they have the disease?

b. If a person has a negative result, what is the probability they do not have the disease?

5. Find the expected value of the following events

a. The sum of numbers on 5 cards drawn from our Kibo deck.

b. The sum of numbers on 10 cards drawn from our Kibo deck.

c. The outcome of 4 coin flips where heads add 1 and tails subtract 1.

d. The multiplication of two rolls of a standard, fair 6-sided die.

6. Draw or graph a probability mass function for the following:

a. The sum of two dice rolls.

b. The results of a single coin flip.

c. The value of a random integer number between 1 and 10.
