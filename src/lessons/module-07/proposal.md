# Project Proposal

Details on the Proposal are in the [Project Document on Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/vmhhhddvvtxy#96435d).

The basic requirements:

- Give a one to three sentence summary of your chosen topic.
- Provide a bulleted list of the sub-topics you will cover.
- Provide a source for each sub-topic that you will get information from.
- Sources may be from Wikipedia or MathStackExchange, but at least two must be textbooks or research papers.
- Using Quora, Reddit, or other blog/social media websites are not generally acceptable as sources.

An example would be:

For my project, I intend to explore a few different ways to select random points from a circle, and some common mistakes people make when selecting random points from a circle.

My main points will be:
