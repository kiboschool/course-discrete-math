# Combinatorics

This week, we'll cover the basic topics of combinatorics. This includes permutations and combinations, Pascal's Triangle, solving counting problems, and combinatorial proofs. The reasoning found in combinatorics is unique, but useful.

By the end of the week, you should be able to:

- Identify counting problems from real-life examples.
- Solve intermediate combinatorial problems using a variety of methods such as casework, complementary counting, overcounting, using identities, and pigeonhole principle.
- Analyze a counting problem to decide which method would be most efficient in solving the problem.
- Identify generating function problems, and recall the basics of generating functions.
