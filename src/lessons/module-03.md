# Recurrence Relations

This week, we'll cover recurrence relations. First, we'll discuss logarithms and summation notation to ensure we can compute the solutions to recurrence relations. Then, we'll discuss recurrence relations, and how they relate to sequences and recursive code.

By the end of the week, you should be able to:

- Understand and use summation notation/big pi notation.
- Evaluate simple logarithms and apply basic logarithmic rules.
- Identify recursive problems.
- Solve simple recursive problems.
- Recall methods of solving harder recursive problems.
