# Homework Set 1

## Submitting Your Work

Your work must be submitted to Anchor for degree credit and to Gradescope for grading.

**For any work completed outside of GitHub or Gradescope:**

1. **Typeset your work in LaTeX**.
 - You should use \\begin\{enumerate\} to create a numbered list, and your solutions to each problem should match with the corresponding number on the assignment.
 - For example, if an assignment has 10 numbered problems, your enumerate should have 10 \\item commands, with your solution(s) to problem 1 under the first \\item, problem 2 under the second and so on.
 - If you skip a problem, just leave the \\item blank, otherwise the numbers of your solutions will not match the assignment document.
[Here is an example Overleaf document showcasing this format.](https://www.overleaf.com/read/zqjgpnxycycd#e88392)
2. Compile into a PDF. This can be done easily through an Overleaf account, otherwise you will need to install LaTeX.
3. Submit the pdf to [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com) via the appropriate submission link for the course.
4. Upload the pdf to Anchor using the form below.

> **Note:** Anchor submissions can occur at any time during the term, but it is **critical** that you upload all of your work to
> Anchor before the last day of the term.  Gradescope submissions must be submitted before the deadline (or the late deadline, if applicable).

#### It is required that all assignments are submitted as a PDF generated from a LaTeX document.

#### Assignments submitted in any other form will earn zero credit.

1. **[5 points]** Why do we pronounce the X in LaTeX differently than one might expect in English?

2. **[10 points]** Add an XKCD comic to your document. You should add the comic as an image, and add a link to the XKCD site to credit the creators. The link should be clickable in the final PDF.

3. **[10 points]** If you had a truth table in a CSV file, and wished to transfer it into LaTeX, would you re-write it by hand or create a program that would typeset the table for you? If you would re-write it, explain why. If you would create a program, write some pseudocode.

4. **[5 points]** Create an example of each of the following in LaTeX: A fraction, an exponent, the greek letter $\sigma$ (sigma), uppercase $\Sigma$ (sigma), and an expression with at least two variables.

5. **[10 points]** Create a truth table for the following expression: $\neg (p \vee q) \wedge r$.

6. **[10 points]** Show that the following expressions are equivalent:

$$(p \vee q) \rightarrow \neg r$$

$$\neg r \vee (\neg p \wedge \neg q)$$

7. **[10 points]** Use a subset proof to show that $(A \cap B) \cup (B \cap C) \equiv B \cap (A \cup C)$.

8. **[10 points]** Write the following in mathematical notation: Set A contains ordered pairs of integers such that these pairs add to 10 or multiply to 16.

9. **[10 points]** Give an example of an equivalence relation, and prove that it is an equivalence relation.

10. **[10 points]** Create an Antisymmetric relation on $\{1,4,9,16,25\}$.

11. **[10 points]** If a relation is not reflexive, does that mean it is irreflexive? If this is true, prove it. If it is false, provide a counterexample.
