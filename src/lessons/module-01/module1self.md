# Week 1: Self-Guided Problems

When you come to class, be ready to discuss these questions, and bring any additional questions you still have after this exercise!

For the first week only, this Self-Guided exercise is due by Friday. All other Self-Guided Problem Sets will be due before class starts.

## Submitting Your Work

Your work must be submitted to Anchor for degree credit and to Gradescope for grading.

**For any work completed outside of GitHub or Gradescope:**

1. **Typeset your work in LaTeX**.
 - You should use \\begin\{enumerate\} to create a numbered list, and your solutions to each problem should match with the corresponding number on the assignment.
 - For example, if an assignment has 10 numbered problems, your enumerate should have 10 \\item commands, with your solution(s) to problem 1 under the first \\item, problem 2 under the second and so on.
 - If you skip a problem, just leave the \\item blank, otherwise the numbers of your solutions will not match the assignment document.
2. Compile into a PDF. This can be done easily through an Overleaf account, otherwise you will need to install LaTeX.
3. Submit the pdf to [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com) via the appropriate submission link for the course.
4. Upload the pdf to Anchor using the form below.

> **Note:** Anchor submissions can occur at any time during the term, but it is **critical** that you upload all of your work to
> Anchor before the last day of the term.  Gradescope submissions must be submitted before the deadline (or the late deadline, if applicable).

#### It is required that all assignments are submitted as a PDF generated from a LaTeX document.

#### Assignments submitted in any other form will earn zero credit.

### Self-Guided Problems cannot be submitted late for any reason

This is due to the fact we discuss them in the class. Be sure to stay on top of these Self-Guided problems, and remember it is better to turn in an incomplete set than an empty one.

## Problems

<ol>
  <li>Create an account with Overleaf. Then create a new document. What are the commands Overleaf includes for you? What do they do?</li>
  <li>Try importing some math-related packages. Here are some examples:

  - \usepackage{amsmath}
  - \usepackage{amsfonts}
  - \usepackaged{amssymb}

  What are some example notations you can use from these packages?
  </li>
  <li>Try finding a mathematical symbol using a search engine, by searching for it by name. Try finding a mathematical symbol using Detextify, by drawing it. 
  
  a. Which is easier?

  b. Did you need any additional packages to support the symbol?</li>
  
  <li>Try typesetting a simple mathematical expression twice, using 2 different ways to enter math mode.
  
  a. Whatâ€™s the difference?

  b. Are there any specific situations where you would choose one over another?

  c. How can you handle text in mathematical expressions?
  
  </li> 
  <li>Try creating a numbered list of items and a bulleted list of items.
  </li>
  <li>How do you create separate paragraphs in LaTeX? </li>
</ol>
