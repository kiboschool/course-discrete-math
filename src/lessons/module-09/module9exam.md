# Final Exam

There will be no homework this week due to the final exam.

We will be conducting the exam using onlineexammaker.

A link to the exam will appear below on 3/4/2024. You must complete the exam by 3/10/2024 11:59PM GMT. No late submissions will be allowed.

You have 30 minutes to take this exam, and it has 14 questions, some multi-select and some short answer.

You must submit any papers with your work on them within 30 minutes of taking the exam. Some questions ask for work to be shown, and these papers will only be considered if they are submitted within 30 minutes of exam submission.

In the exam, you may see the following notation. This is what it means:

R -> R -- $\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$.

1/2 -- The fraction one half.

x^2 -- x raised to the second power.

a_n -- a subscript n.

123_4 -- $123_4$ or 123 base 4

x = 4 mod 5 -- $x \equiv 4 \mod{5}$

You may use any of this shorthand in your own answers.

Feel free to do questions in any order.

## Resources

This is an open note, open book exam, but it is not open internet.

The following resources are allowed:
- Readings on Anchor.
- Textbooks linked on Anchor.
- Your own notes on material.
- Class recordings (though these will be too time consuming for an exam).

The following resources are **not** allowed:
- MathStackExchange, Khan Academy, or any other online math resource not listed above.
- ChatGPT, Bard, or any other AI service.
- Any other person than yourself (no peers, family members, or otherwise can help you on your exam).
- Any other resources not explicitly listed in the "allowed" list.

Using any unapproved resources during an exam counts as academic dishonesty, and may result in a zero on the exam.

The exam is timed to make sure you do not rely entirely on notes. You will not be able to complete this exam without knowing most of the material well. You should not need to reference your notes for every problem, as if you do, you will not have time to complete all problems on the exam.
