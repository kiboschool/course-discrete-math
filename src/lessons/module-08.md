# Number Theory II

This week, we'll continue discussing topics related to Number Theory, diving deep into Modular Arithmetic and solving Linear Congruences.

## Readings

[Chapter 2.3](https://math.gordon.edu/ntic/ntic/section-euclid-alg.html)
[Chapter 4](https://math.gordon.edu/ntic/ntic/chapter-intro-congruence.html)
[Chapter 5](https://math.gordon.edu/ntic/ntic/chapter-linear-congruences.html)
[Chapter 8.5](https://math.gordon.edu/ntic/ntic/section-wilson-flt.html)

By the end of the week, you should be able to:

- Identify problems that may be related to modular arithmetic.
- Solve one-variable linear congruences.
- Solve simple multi-variable linear congruences.
- Apply the Euclidean Algorithm and the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.
- Remember useful theorems regarding modular arithmetic and prime numbers.
