# Sequences and Functions

This week, we'll cover sequences and functions. While some material should be review from Mathematical Thinking, we will cover some new topics in these fields.

By the end of the week, you should be able to:

- Identify and solve arithmetic and geometric sequences/series.
- Recall other methods to solve series.
- Analyze simple functions.
- Determine the type and inverse of simple functions, as well as their compositions.
- Prove a function is injective, surjective, or bijective.
- Prove a set is countable.
