# Combinatorial Proofs & Probability

This week, we'll cover probability. This includes a probability definition for discrete and continuous probability, related probability notions of independence, conditional probability, expected value, and probability distributions.

## Readings

[Introduction to Probability](https://math.dartmouth.edu/~prob/prob/prob.pdf)
[Chapter 1](https://math.dartmouth.edu/~prob/prob/prob.pdf#page=9)
