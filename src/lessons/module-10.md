# Applications

This week we will discuss many applications of mathematics. Hopefully, you all have good ideas for your project by now, and think it would make a good addition to the content here!

## Readings

Instead of readings this week, I highly encourage you to check out some videos from the SOME competitions. Here are the three playlists for the three summers:

[SOME 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJWnA4j0_ho&list=PLnQX-jgAF5pTkwtUuVpqS5tuWmJ-6ZM-Z)

[SOME 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDofhN-RJqg&list=PLnQX-jgAF5pTZXPiD8ciEARRylD9brJXU)

[SOME 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a1fLEToyvU&list=PLnQX-jgAF5pQS2GUFCsatSyZkSH7e8UM8&index=1)

Pick a few videos that interest you, and watch them. I am giving you a bit less reading than usual, so be sure to take this time to explore whatever topics interest you from any of the hundreds of videos featured in these playlists.

By the end of the week, you should be able to:

- List many applications of discrete mathematics throughout computer science.
