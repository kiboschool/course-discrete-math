# Week 2: Self-Guided Problems

When you come to class, be ready to discuss these questions, and bring any additional questions you still have after this exercise!

## Submitting Your Work

Your work must be submitted to Anchor for degree credit and to Gradescope for grading.

**For any work completed outside of GitHub or Gradescope:**

1. **Typeset your work in LaTeX**.
 - You should use \\begin\{enumerate\} to create a numbered list, and your solutions to each problem should match with the corresponding number on the assignment.
 - For example, if an assignment has 10 numbered problems, your enumerate should have 10 \\item commands, with your solution(s) to problem 1 under the first \\item, problem 2 under the second and so on.
 - If you skip a problem, just leave the \\item blank, otherwise the numbers of your solutions will not match the assignment document.
2. Compile into a PDF. This can be done easily through an Overleaf account, otherwise you will need to install LaTeX.
3. Submit the pdf to [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com) via the appropriate submission link for the course.
4. Upload the pdf to Anchor using the form below.

> **Note:** Anchor submissions can occur at any time during the term, but it is **critical** that you upload all of your work to
> Anchor before the last day of the term.  Gradescope submissions must be submitted before the deadline (or the late deadline, if applicable).

#### It is required that all assignments are submitted as a PDF generated from a LaTeX document.

#### Assignments submitted in any other form will earn zero credit.

### Self-Guided Problems cannot be submitted late for any reason

This is due to the fact we discuss them in the class. Be sure to stay on top of these Self-Guided problems, and remember it is better to turn in an incomplete set than an empty one.

## Problems

1. Consider a sequence where the first two terms are 1 and 2.

- What would be the next term if it was an arithmetic sequence?
- What would be the next term if it was a geometric sequence?

2. Create your own sequence that starts with 1 and 2. What is the rule for each term in the sequence? Is there a closed form solution for the $n$th term of your sequence? What about the sum up to the $n$th term?

3. Write code in the language of your choice to calculate the $n$th term of the sequence defined by $$a_n = a_{n-1} + 3, a_0 = 0$$

In two different ways:

- Using a for loop to compute from $a_0$ to $a_n$
- Using the closed form for the expression.

Try running the code both ways for $n = 1, 100, 10,000,$ and $1,000,000$.

4. Is there a significant time difference between the two methods? If there is, at what point do you notice a difference?

5. Does the countability of a set imply anything about the span of the set? That is, the difference between the smallest and the largest values? What about uncountable sets?

6. Prove f(x) is bijective. $$f(x) = \frac{3}{2}x + 6$$

7. Show g(x) is not bijective $$g(x) = 7x^4$$

8. What are some indicators that a function is bijective? Are there any indicators that a function is not bijective?
