# Homework Set 2

## Submitting Your Work

Your work must be submitted to Anchor for degree credit and to Gradescope for grading.

**For any work completed outside of GitHub or Gradescope:**

1. **Typeset your work in LaTeX**.
 - You should use \\begin\{enumerate\} to create a numbered list, and your solutions to each problem should match with the corresponding number on the assignment.
 - For example, if an assignment has 10 numbered problems, your enumerate should have 10 \\item commands, with your solution(s) to problem 1 under the first \\item, problem 2 under the second and so on.
 - If you skip a problem, just leave the \\item blank, otherwise the numbers of your solutions will not match the assignment document.
[Here is an example Overleaf document showcasing this format.](https://www.overleaf.com/read/zqjgpnxycycd#e88392)
2. Compile into a PDF. This can be done easily through an Overleaf account, otherwise you will need to install LaTeX.
3. Submit the pdf to [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com) via the appropriate submission link for the course.
4. Upload the pdf to Anchor using the form below.

> **Note:** Anchor submissions can occur at any time during the term, but it is **critical** that you upload all of your work to
> Anchor before the last day of the term.  Gradescope submissions must be submitted before the deadline (or the late deadline, if applicable).

#### It is required that all assignments are submitted as a PDF generated from a LaTeX document.

#### Assignments submitted in any other form will earn zero credit.

1. **[35 points]** Find the closed form for the following series, up to the $n$th term. If the infinite series has a finite solution, write it down.

    a. 1 + 4 + 7 + 10 + 13 + ...

    b. $a_n = 3 \cdot a_{n-1}$, $a_0 = 2$

    c. 5 + 17 + 29 + 41 + 53 + ...

    d. $a_n = a_{n-1} + 4$, $a_0 = -1$

    e. $\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{18} + \frac{1}{54} + \frac{1}{162} + ... $

    f. -15 + -13 + -11 + -9 + -7 + ...
    
    g. $\frac{1}{5} - \frac{1}{35} + \frac{1}{245} - \frac{1}{1715} + \frac{1}{12005} - ...$
