# Review of Mathematical Thinking and LaTeX

This week, we will review key concepts from Mathematical Thinking, and we'll discuss how to typeset in LaTeX.

By the end of this week, you should be able to:

- Evaluate logical statements and create truth tables.
- Use logic laws to show two propositions are equivalent.
- Write a subset proof to prove equivalence of 2 sets.
- Use mathematical notation from set theory and logic.
- Create simple relations which have different properties (eg symmetric, reflexive, etc), analyze complex relations (defined by functions or statements).
- Create LaTeX documents with simple features such as lists, tables, embeded links and images.
- Implement and modify/organize lines from other LaTeX documents/examples when needed (tikz, etc).
- Use LaTeX tools for more complex symbols or equations.
