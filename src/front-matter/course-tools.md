# Course Tools
<!-- UPDATE EACH TERM -->

In this course, we are using these tools to work on code. If you haven't set up
your laptop and installed the software yet, follow the guide in
[https://github.com/kiboschool/setup-guides](https://github.com/kiboschool/setup-guides).

- **Overleaf** is a document management system for LaTeX documents. Almost all assignments will need to be created in LaTeX, so you should try to become familiar with LaTeX and Overleaf in the first week. You do not need to download anything for Overleaf to function, just create an account using your Kibo Google account.
- **Anchor** is Kibo's Learning Management System (LMS). You will access your
  course content through this website, track your progress, and see your grades
  through this site.
- **Gradescope** is a grading platform. We'll use it to track assignment
  submissions and give you feedback on your work.
- **Woolf** is our accreditation partner. We'll track work there too, so that
  you get credit towards your degree.
