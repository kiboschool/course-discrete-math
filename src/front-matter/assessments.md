# Assessments & Grading

You overall course grade is composed of these weighted elements:

- 9% - Self-Guided Problem Sets (9 Sets) *(No Late Submissions)*
- 21% - Homework Assignments (7 Sets)
- 20% - Midterm Exam *(No Late Submissions)*
- 20% - Final Exam *(No Late Submissions)*
- 30% - Final Project


## Self-Guided Problem Sets

Every week, except for week 10, will have a self-guided problem set. The first is due on the first Friday of the term, but the rest are due before class.

These are low-stakes assessments meant to help you assess your own level of understandings before joining the class.

These problem sets **cannot be turned in late**.

Students must use LaTeX to write their solutions, and submit the compiled PDF to Anchor and Gradescope.

## Homework Assignments

There will be 7 homework sets in total, covering most weeks. These are due on Friday, and are meant to test your understanding of the week's material.

Students must use LaTeX to write their solutions, and submit the compiled PDF to Anchor and Gradescope.

## Midterm Exam & Final Exam

There will be a midterm exam held during the middle of the term (week 4) and a final exam at the end of the term (week 8). More details to come.

## Final Project

You will complete a final project for this course in the form of a "math explainer." By this, I mean some content, which could be a blog post with images, a youtube video, or some other method of conveying some mathematical topic.

[This link](https://www.3blue1brown.com/blog/some1-results) is to a past contest for this type of content, and while the math explained in most of these math explainers is above the level of this course, it gives a good idea of what may be expected of you for this project.

## Late Policy

You are expected to submit your work by the deadline. Each assignment page will include instructions and a link to submit.

The table above specifies the assignments for which late submission is possible. Any work submitted late will incur penalties in accordance with Kibo's [Late Work Policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zbax0XgKMoI58lOlTzJBzcZnUGodiqoOhvM4W9DFJ_M/preview#heading=h.c0d150s5aj8d).
